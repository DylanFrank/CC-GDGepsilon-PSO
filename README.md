The files are organised as below:

- code: the main file contained all code
    - main.m: main function
    - CEC2010: the CEC2010 benchmark function
    - some other files are introduced in paper.

- curve: running figure
- doc: first draft
- paper: corr paper
- result: computation result
- batch.py: for running in computer cluster.
